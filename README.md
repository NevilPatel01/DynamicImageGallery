# Dynamic Image Gallery

Welcome to the Dynamic Image Gallery project! This project demonstrates the implementation of JavaScript event handling, DOM manipulation, and responsive design to create an interactive web application. Let's delve into the features and implementation details of this project.

## Features Implemented:

1. Event Handling with JavaScript:

- Utilized JavaScript to detect and respond to events within the HTML/CSS environment.
- Implemented event listeners to trigger actions such as image changes, timer updates, and manual refresh.

2. Dynamic Image Display:

- Integrated functionality to display a set of images in a grid format.
- Implemented logic to randomly select and replace images upon user interaction.

3. Timer Functionality:

- Implemented countdown timer functionality to indicate the time until the next automatic refresh.
- Utilized timers to control different functions with varying timeout values.

4. Styling and Design:

- Ensured all elements are styled professionally for a visually appealing user interface.
- Implemented transitions and color scheme changes to enhance user experience.

## Implementation Details:

### Project Structure:

- index.html: Main HTML file showcasing the project's features.
- script.js: External JavaScript file containing the logic for event handling and DOM manipulation.
- styles.css: External CSS file for styling the components and layout.
- assets: Directory containing images and other resource files used in the project.

### Image Display:

- Displayed images evenly spaced and responsive within the main element.
- Implemented logic to randomly select and display images from predefined themes.

### Input Element:

- Integrated an input element to accept a numeric value within a specified range.
- Validated input using JavaScript to ensure it falls within the valid range.

### Randomize Button:

- Implemented a button to randomly select and replace images upon user interaction.
- Reset automatic refresh timer and update the image change counter accordingly.

### Clock:

- Implemented a countdown timer to indicate the time until the next automatic refresh.
- Changed the color scheme of the timer window based on countdown progress.

### Image Change Counter:

- Displayed real-time count of how many times the images have been changed.

## Note:

This project was developed as part of an assignment for COMP 10259. It required meticulous planning and implementation of various features, including event handling, timer functionality, and dynamic image display.
